    "### Creating a river network grid\n",
    "The first thing we'll do is create a landlab `NetworkModelGrid` from two shapefiles of a tiny little basin: one containing **points** at the node locations (populated with elevation and drainage area data), and the other containing **polylines** representing the links (populated with channel slope, reach length and drainage area data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this for a basin of your own? A starting guideline is to create links that are relatively consistent length, editing the network as needed to ensure that no links are much smaller than others. Very small links will have very small active layer volumes, and may be prone to runaway aggradation if transport capacity is slightly lower than the upstream links. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a small, simple river network, these shapefiles are easy to create yourself in GIS from a DEM. However, for a larger one this would become cumbersome. You have two good options for streamlining this process: \n",
    "1. Scott David (USU) and colleagues at Utah State have created a set of tools for extracting a river network and all the attributes you'd like from a DEM [(USUAL Watershed Tools, David et al., 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364815222002766).\n",
    "2. Shelby Ahrendt (USGS) and Eric Hutton (CSDMS) have created a much simpler, though somewhat more limited tool, to create a network model grid from a DEM in just a few lines of code. [This landlab tutorial](https://landlab.csdms.io/tutorials/network_sediment_transporter/create_networkgrid_from_rastergrid.html) notebook explains its use.  "
